# Homework Guidelines

Learning programming and mathematics are “doing intensive” enterprises: you learn by doing them. We will have weekly homework assignments. These will primarily be programming problems but will also include some written responses and some basic mathematics exercises. All homework solutions will be submitted as Jupyter notebooks. Written responses will be entered in Markdown cells and programming responses will be entered in code cells.

Grading will be based on the following rubric:

* ✓ +: (100%) Student went beyond expectations. Program (if relevant) runs as expected. Code is clean and well commented. Written explanations are accurate and thorough.
* ✓ : (90%) Program (if relevant) run as expected. Written explanations are accurate.
* ✓ -: (70%) Program (if relevant) is completed but does not run as expected. Written explanations are partially correct
* F: (0%) Submitted solutions are either absent or do not demonstrate a realistic effort to address the problem.

Homework will be submitted using a git repository (e.g. on GitHub or Bitbucket) each student creates and to which the instructor and TA are added as collaborators. I've made a short, and not very entertaining video about how to do that here (Links to an external site.)

Homework can be (indeed are encouraged to be) worked on in groups, but each student will submit their own homework. Homework solutions will be reviewed in class and each student must be prepared to defend/explain their homework solutions to the rest of the class during the beginning of the Thursday class period (part of the class participation grade).

Homework assignments will be assigned with each module throughout the week and will be due one week after they are assigned (an explicit due date and time will be given with each assignment). Late homework assignments will be scored at 80% of earned credit. Homework assignments can be regraded for up to half the marked-down score in conjunction with personal meetings with a TA.
