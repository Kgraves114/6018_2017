# Term Projects
## Course Project Policy

An introductory course cannot cover all the programming topics that may be of interest to a student, and because we want the course to be as applicable as possible to the student’s graduate research or application experience, the course project is a way for students to customize their learning experience.

The course project represents a significant programming project addressing a problem of interest (use case) to the student(s), hopefully related to their field of research or application. The work involved in this project should represent an effort equivalent to three to four homework assignments.

The project should have at least the following components:

1. An open source license.
1. A class that you have defined and an derived class that inherits from this parent class. The classes can be simple, but you should have at least a useful ``__str__`` method.
1. Read or write from a database such as SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB.
1. A user interface. This could be a web application (such as Flask or Django); an application built with pyQT4 or wxWindows; an Jupyter notebook with widgets; or a command line interface. If you use an Jupyter notebook, you must create at least two custom widgets see this for some guidance.
1. Some sort of visualization. This can be a static matplotlib-generated figure or an interactive plot with Bokeh or mpld3.
1. A detailed README.md (or README.rst) that describes the problem your project is addressing including any domain knowledge that will help someone (me) outside of your expertise appreciate the intent of the project, provides a description of the dependencies (any install instructions), instructions on how to use the project with example use cases.
1. The project should be well written Python program that follows Google’s Python style guide.

Create a separate Bitbucket (or GitHub) repository for the project.
