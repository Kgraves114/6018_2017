##   Prerequisite
                               A basic programming course, such as CodeAcademy’s Python Course
##  Course Description

This course will provide students in the biological and medical domains the foundational programming skills to create computer programs to manage and analyze data drawn from clinical, biological, and public health domains. Working with the Python programming language, students will learn how to write procedural and object oriented programs. Mathematical principles relevant to biomedical data science will be reviewed through programming examples and problems. Students will also develop competency in using software version control with git as well as how to work within Linux environments.

##  Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course students will be able to:

1. Use basic mathematical principles (e.g. set theory, first order logic, calculus, linear algebra, probability, and graph theory) to motivate and inform computational problems in biology and healthcare.

1. Follow software engineering principles such as version control, documentation, and testing while developing biomedical software.
1. Develop biomedical software applications in the Python programming language.
1. Develop pipelines for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing biomedical data.

## Evaluation Methods

1. Quizzes: 15% of grade
1. Class Participation: 15% of grade
    1. I will not keep attendance, but do expect reasonable attendance and participation with in-class activities, peer review of assignments, etc.
1. Homework Assignments: 40%
1. Term Project: 30%

**No tests will be given**

##  Teaching and Learning Methods                 

This class will follow a “flipped classroom” paradigm. Students will be expected to watch prepared videos and read relevant on-line materials prior to the start of class. Class time will be spent answering questions raised by on-line materials, clarifying topics, and participating in individual and group hands-on activities. Students are encouraged to work in groups.

## Writing

While this course does not include a formal written component, students are required to write documentation for all their code following standard Python conventions.

## Analytical

The analytical component of this course includes review of foundational mathematical concepts that are of importance to biomedical informatics.
